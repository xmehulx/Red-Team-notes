Kerberoasting is a lateral movement/privilege escalation technique in AD environments, targetting [Service Principal Names (SPN)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/ad/service-principal-names) accounts. SPNs are unique identifiers that Kerberos uses to map a service instance to a service account in whose context the service is running. Any domain user can request a Kerberos ticket for any service account in the same domain, and also across forest trusts (if authentication is permitted across the trust boundary).

# Requirements
1. An account's cleartext password/NTLM hash
2. Shell under domain user account
OR
1. `SYSTEM` shell on a domain-joined host

# The Attack
Depending on our position in a network, this attack can be performed in multiple ways:
- From a non-domain joined Linux host using valid domain user credentials.
- From a domain-joined Linux host as root after retrieving the keytab file.
- From a domain-joined Windows host authenticated as a domain user.
- From a domain-joined Windows host with a shell in the context of a domain account.
- As SYSTEM on a domain-joined Windows host.
- From a non-domain joined Windows host using [runas](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2012-r2-and-2012/cc771525(v=ws.11)) /netonly.

Several tools can be utilized to perform the attack:

- Impacket’s [GetUserSPNs.py](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket/blob/master/examples/GetUserSPNs.py) from a non-domain joined Linux host.
- A combination of the built-in setspn.exe Windows binary, PowerShell, and Mimikatz.
- From Windows, utilizing tools such as PowerView, [Rubeus](https://github.com/GhostPack/Rubeus), and other PowerShell scripts.
