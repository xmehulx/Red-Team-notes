[AppLocker](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-defender-application-control/applocker/what-is-applocker)Â is Microsoft's application whitelisting solution and gives system administrators control over which applications and files users can run. It provides granular control over executables, scripts, Windows installer files, DLLs, packaged apps, and packed app installers. It is common for organizations to block cmd.exe and PowerShell.exe and write access to certain directories, but this can all be bypassed.

```powershell
PS > Get-AppLockerPolicy -Effective | select -ExpandProperty RuleCollections
