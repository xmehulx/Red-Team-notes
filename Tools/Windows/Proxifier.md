[Proxifier](https://www.proxifier.com/)Â is a Windows tool that creates a tunneled network for desktop client applications and allows it to operate through a SOCKS or HTTPS proxy and allows for proxy chaining. We can also create a profile where we can provide the configuration for our SOCKS server started by Plink on port 9050. It can be used to start a SOCKS tunnel via the SSH session we created.
