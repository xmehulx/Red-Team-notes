[Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/wmisdk/about-wmi)Â is a scripting engine used to retrieve information and run administrative tasks on local and remote hosts. It can also create a WMI report on domain users, groups, processes, and other information from our host and other domain hosts.

It allows read and write access to almost all settings on Windows systems. WMI consists of several programs and various databases known as repositories.
