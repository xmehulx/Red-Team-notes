| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `cap_sys_admin`    | Allows to perform actions with administrative privileges, such as modifying system files or changing system settings.                                     |
| `cap_sys_chroot`   | Allows to change the root directory for the current process, allowing it to access files and directories that would otherwise be inaccessible.            |
| `cap_sys_ptrace`   | Allows to attach to and debug other processes, potentially allowing it to gain access to sensitive information or modify the behavior of other processes. |
| `cap_sys_nice`     | Allows to raise or lower the priority of processes, potentially allowing it to gain access to resources that would otherwise be restricted.               |
| `cap_sys_time`     | Allows to modify the system clock, potentially allowing it to manipulate timestamps or cause other processes to behave in unexpected ways.                |
| `cap_sys_resource` | Allows to modify system resource limits, such as the maximum number of open file descriptors or the maximum amount of memory that can be allocated.       |
| `cap_setuid`       | Allows a process to set its effective user ID, which can be used to gain the privileges of another user, including the `root` user.                       |
| `cap_setgid`       | Allows to set its effective group ID, which can be used to gain the privileges of another group, including the `root` group.                              |
| `cap_dac_override` | Allows bypassing of file read, write, and execute permission checks.                                                                                      |

| `=`                   | This value sets the specified capability for the executable, but does not grant any privileges. This can be useful if we want to clear a previously set capability for the executable.                                                                                                                                                         |
| `+ep`                 | This value grants the effective and permitted privileges for the specified capability to the executable. This allows the executable to only perform the actions that the capability allows.                                                                                                                                                    |
| `+ei`                 | This value grants sufficient and inheritable privileges for the specified capability to the executable. This allows the executable to perform the actions that the capability allows and child processes spawned by the executable to inherit the capability and perform the same actions.                                                     |
| `+p`                  | This value grants the permitted privileges for the specified capability to the executable. This allows the executable to only perform the actions that the capability allows. This can be useful if we want to grant the capability to the executable but prevent it from inheriting the capability or allowing child processes to inherit it. |
