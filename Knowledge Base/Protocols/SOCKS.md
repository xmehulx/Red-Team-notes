# #SOCKS
It is a protocol that facilitates the routing of network traffic through a proxy server. It operates at the transport layer and is used to establish a connection between a client and a server over the internet, often for the purposes of improving security, anonymity, or bypassing restrictions.

Unlike most cases where we would initiate a connection to connect to a service, in the case of SOCKS, the initial traffic is generated by a SOCKS client, which connects to the SOCKS server controlled by the user who wants to access a service on the client-side. Once the connection is established, network traffic can be routed through the SOCKS server on behalf of the connected client.

This is often used to circumvent the restrictions placed by firewalls, and allow an external entity to bypass the firewall and access a service within the firewalled environment. One more benefit of using SOCKS proxy for pivoting and forwarding data is that SOCKS proxies can pivot via creating a route to an external server fromÂ `NAT networks`.
