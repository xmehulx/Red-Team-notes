The concept is based on four categories that occur for each vulnerability. 
1. We have a `Source` that performs the specific request...
2. To a `Process` where the vulnerability gets triggered.
3. Each process has a specific set of `Privileges` with which it is executed. 
4. Each process has a task with a specific goal or `Destination` to either compute new data or forward it. 
However, the individual and unique specifications under these categories may differ from service to service.
